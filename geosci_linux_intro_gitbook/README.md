# Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to familiarise yourself with the UNIX based computing systems in the School of GeoSciences.

UNIX based operating systems give much more control to the user compared with a Windows Operating System. The most common and powerful method of interaction with a UNIX based system is through the command line rather than through a windows-like point and click interface. Additionally, much of the software available on UNIX platforms is free and open source, meaning that everybody has access to the code used to create a piece of software, meaning that you know exactly what the program is doing. Having this amount of control over your computing is very useful in academia where research should be entirely [reproducible and repeatable](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/56/12/958/221622). Using a text interface will also give you a lot more creative power to design analyses the way you like.

Students use the GeoSciences UNIX systems for a variety of tasks, including but not limited to:

- Simulation modelling
- GIS and mapping
- Running an email server
- Statistical programming

While this workshop is not designed to be a definitive reference, it should provide a good introduction from which you can continue to learn about this powerful resource.

All the introduction materials, including the raw files for this [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), can be found here:

```

Either work through the chapters in this book sequentially, or choose a specific topic you would like to learn more about.

## By the end of this workshop you should be able to:

- Log on to any UNIX machine in the School of GeoSciences
- Locate your home directory
- Perform simple file operations on the command line using, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`
- View plain text files in a number of different ways using pagers and editors
- Find help on commands/programs using `man` pages
- Download and retrieve data via FTP
- Monitor memory usage, and find out about other users on the system using `finger`, `ps`, `kill`
- Search within files using `grep`
- Connect to the GeoSciences Linux server using a graphical client
- Map GeoSciences network drives on your personal computer
- Tell other people how awesome UNIX is
