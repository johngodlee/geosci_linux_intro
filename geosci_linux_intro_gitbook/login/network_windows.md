# Adding a network drive on Windows

Make sure you are connected to the University VPN.

Click `Start`, `Computer`.

Click `Map Network Drive`

Pick an available letter, e.g. `G`

Enter the folder address as:

```
\\students.geos.ed.ac.uk\s1234567
```

replacing `s1234567` with your own UUN.

You can use the same method as above to add the "Research DataStore", which gives every research student and staff member 500GB of backed up storage space. The address to add is:

```
\\csce.datastore.ed.ac.uk\csce\geos\users\s1234567
```

replacing `s1234567` with your own UUN.
