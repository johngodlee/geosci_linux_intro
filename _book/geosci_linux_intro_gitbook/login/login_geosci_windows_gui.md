# Logging in to a GUI from a GeoSciences Windows machine

Open "NX Connection Wizard" from the Start menu.

Configure the connection like so:

- "Session" = `burn.geos.ed.ac.uk`
- "Host" = `burn.geos.ed.ac.uk`
- "Port" = `22`
- "Select type of your internet connection." = `ADSL`
- "Client" = `Unix`
- "Desktop environment" = `KDE` - __This can be changed__
- "Select size of your remote desktop" = `Available area` - __This can be changed__

Then when the login window appears, login with your UUN and the password you use to login to MyEd.
