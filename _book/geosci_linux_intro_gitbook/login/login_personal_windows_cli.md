# Logging in to the command line from a personal Windows machine

You can also use PuTTY from your own windows machine, you can download it from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

Make sure you are connected to the University VPN service ([more information can be found here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn)), then open PuTTY and connect using the same options as the ones above for a GeoSciences Windows machine.
