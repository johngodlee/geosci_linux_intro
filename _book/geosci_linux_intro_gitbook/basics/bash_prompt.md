# The Bash prompt

By this point you should be connected to the Linux `burn` server using whatever means suits you, if not, go back and try again, using one of the options above. When you first login your terminal window should look something like this:

```
[s1234567@burn ~]$ â– 
```

This innocuous line, known as the bash prompt actually tells us some really useful information:

- `s1234567` is obviously your UUN.
- `burn` is the hostname, i.e. the name of the server you are connected to.
- `~` Is the directory you are currently in, `~` is shorthand for the home directory.
- `$` marks the end of the bash prompt and the start of the space where you can type commands.
