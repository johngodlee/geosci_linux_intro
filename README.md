# Introduction to the University of Edinburgh, School of GeoSciences Linux Environment

This is a short workshop I have written as an update to the 2017 "Intro. to Linux in GeoSciences" course run for new Postgraduate students during orientation week.

It exists either as a single HTML document which is hosted here, to be worked through all at once, or as a GitBook in another repo which splits the information down into smaller more manageable chunks.

Until this is published properly, there are a few ways to view the content:

To run the standalone HTML document:
- Clone the repo
- View the `.html` file in a web browser.

To view the gitbook, go to:

OR
