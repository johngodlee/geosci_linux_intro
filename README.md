# Introduction to the University of Edinburgh, School of GeoSciences Linux Environment

This is a short workshop I have written as an update to the 2017 "Intro. to Linux in GeoSciences" course run for new Postgraduate students during orientation week.

It exists either as a single HTML document, to be worked through all at once, or as a GitBook which splits the information down into smaller more manageable chunks.

Until this is published properly, there are a few ways to view the content:

To run the standalone HTML document:
- Clone the repo
- View the `.html` file in a web browser.

To run the Gitbook: 
- Clone the repo 
- run `gitbook serve` inside `geosci_linux_intro_gitbook/` ([Download gitbook from here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook))

OR

- Clone the repo
- Open `geosci_linux_intro_gitbook/` in the [Gitbook editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor)
